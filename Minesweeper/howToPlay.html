<p>How To Play</p>
<p>Minesweeper involved a grid of tiles, where mines are randomly hidden under a certain number of mines. Click to reveal the tiles, but if you click a mine, you lose! To determine which tiles you should not click, each square has a number with the number of mines that are present of the 8 tiles surrounding it. Right-click to reveal a cell, left click to switch between a flag, a question mark, and a blank. The first cell you click will never be a mine. You win the game by clicking all times except the ones with the mines!</p>
<p>Good luck!! &lt;3</p>
